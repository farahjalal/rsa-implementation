# RSA Cryptographic Implementation (NTL-based)

This project implements a simplified RSA cryptographic algorithm in C++ using the NTL (Number Theory Library).

The program demonstrates:
- RSA key generation
- Encryption
- Decryption
- Big integer modular arithmetic

This implementation was built as an educational cryptography project.

## Requirements

- macOS
- NTL library
- GMP library
- C++ compiler (clang++ or g++)

Install dependencies using Homebrew:

brew install ntl gmp

## Build

Compile using the Makefile:

make

## Run

./rsa

## Notes

This project is for educational purposes only and is not intended for real-world security use.
